# Guide for Installing WSL2 and Docker on Windows
Step 1: Check Windows Requirements

Ensure that your Windows machine meets the following requirements:

    Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education edition
    64-bit processor with virtualization support
    At least 4 GB of RAM (8 GB or more recommended)
    Sufficient available storage space for Docker images and containers

Step 2: Enable Virtualization

Check if virtualization is enabled on your machine. Most modern computers have virtualization enabled by default, but it's good to verify. Here's how:

    Restart your computer and enter the BIOS setup by pressing the appropriate key during startup (e.g., F2, F10, Del, or Esc).
    Look for virtualization-related settings, such as "Virtualization," "VT-x," or "AMD-V," and ensure they are enabled.
    Save changes and exit the BIOS setup.

Step 3: Install WSL2

WSL2 is a compatibility layer for running Linux distributions natively on Windows. Here's how to install WSL2:

    Open a web browser and go to the Microsoft Store.
    Search for "WSL" in the search bar and select "Windows Subsystem for Linux" from the search results.
    Click the "Get" button to download and install WSL2 on your Windows machine.
    Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Step 4: Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is the Docker platform for Windows that allows you to create, run, and manage Docker containers. Here's how to install Docker Desktop:

    Open a web browser and go to the Docker website (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
    Click the "Download" button to download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.
    Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker Desktop.
    During the installation process, Docker Desktop will prompt you to enable Hyper-V and WSL2 features. Make sure to enable them.
    Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will launch automatically.

Step 5: Verify Docker Installation

After installing Docker Desktop, you can verify the installation by running the following commands in a command prompt or PowerShell window:

    Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
    Run the command docker version to verify that Docker is installed and running.
    Run the command docker info to view detailed information about your Docker installation.

Step 6: Test Docker with Hello World

To test your Docker installation, you can run the "Hello World" container, which is a simple Docker image that displays a "Hello from Docker!" message. Here's how:

    Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
    Run the command docker run hello-world to download and run the "Hello World" container image.
    If everything is working correctly, you should see a "Hello from Docker!" message in the output.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed WSL2 and Docker on your Windows machine. You can now start using Docker to create, run, and manage Docker containers for your development or production environments. Refer to the Docker documentation (https://docs.docker.com/) for more information on using Docker and its features.
