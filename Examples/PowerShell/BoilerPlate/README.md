This template includes the following elements:

- Function definition: Starts with the `function` keyword followed by the function name, followed by the function logic enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- `[CmdletBinding()]`: This attribute enables advanced function features like parameter validation, pipeline input, and more.
- `param`: Defines the function parameters with their names, types, and optional attributes.
- Function logic: Contains the code that executes the function's purpose, which can include data manipulation, error handling, and other logic.
- `try` and `catch`: Optional error handling using a `try` block to handle exceptions that may occur within the function.
- Output: Shows an example of how to write output from the function using the `Write-Output` cmdlet.

You can customize this boilerplate code by updating the function name, parameters, and logic to suit your specific requirements. You can also add additional parameters, logic, and output as needed for your specific function.
